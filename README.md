How to add variables, if else statements, and for and while loops

## Functions and Nested Loops
How to use functions and nest loops (while loops)

## Debugging
Understanding why a code program isn't working.

## More Functions...
More functions and nested loops


## My process
Started with the reading of C programming language, watching youtube videos and other online resources. 




### What I learned

At first, i thought it would be a walk in the park when i first saw the project and tasks. C is quite complicated and easy at the same time i must confess. Having to get to understand "the concept" is something i need to read more on. Coding is something you have to practice everyday, even if it is just for 10 mins a day. You leave it, you forget it!. Patience is also important when it comes to getting the hang of coding. Take your time, no need to rush.



```c
#include <stdio.h>
printf("Hello, World");
```


### Continued development

I will definetly definitely keep practicing. With more practice comes more growth.
